## Multi Store (Dynamic E-Commerce Project)
### Overview
#### This project is a dynamic e-commerce homepage designed to enhance the shopping experience. It features an image carousel, a category navigation dropdown, a search function, and responsive product cards.

### Approach
#### Image Carousel: Implemented using Owl Carousel, which showcases product images and includes a welcoming overlay for users.
#### Category Navigation: A button with a dropdown lets users quickly explore product categories, including Electronics, Jewelry, Men’s Clothing, and Women’s Clothing.
#### Search Functionality: A real-time search bar enables users to find specific products by name, enhancing usability.
#### Responsive Design: Utilized Flexbox for a clean, organized layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
### Challenges Faced
#### Carousel Integration: Initially struggled with setting up the Owl Carousel, particularly with the configuration options. After consulting the documentation and examples, I was able to customize it to fit my needs.
#### Responsive Layout: Ensuring the layout was consistently responsive across different screen sizes required extensive testing and adjustments to CSS styles.
#### Search Functionality: Implementing a live search feature with filtering was challenging, but I overcame this by leveraging Angular's built-in functionalities.
